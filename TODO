Test Biokey() more, fill gaps in conversion pairs, keep node labels (descriptions, taxon names) everywhere, add object type checks, modularize

Test experimental Misclass() code, especially with table()-specific functions and NAs (but "ignore" seems to work)

Think if it is possible to optimize BestOverlap() with parallel::mclapply() or similar

Think how to optimize Gap.code(); possible alternative: rle() each sequence, then extract pos/len of gaps and match (and check inclusions) sequence gaps in the union of all gaps

Think how to standardize MrBayes() writing Nexus (now there are two ways, "old ips" and "direct")

Idea: Booster() analogous to Tapkee(); modify BootA() to use it

Idea: create a flower formula representation (likely list), make code to find the shortest path between two formulas with elementary operations (Antopolsky's ideas), make code to use formulas for creation of SVG flower diagrams (Kebert's PHP code)

Idea: HHomonyms() to work with API or directly with hemihomonyms database; maybe, it deserves the separate package

Idea: Coarse(phylo) on the base of ape::di2multi() which allows for given number of hierarchies (maybe, by iteration), collapsing and keeping nodes using e.g., bootstrap support

Idea: Normalize.ranks(classif) to (1) fit ranks into given list and (2) propagate main (whole numbers) ranks (based on code from Biokey())

Idea: create dichotomous key from binary table using rpart::rpart() as helper; look on DichotomousKey Github package

Idea: using Hcoords() and Tcoords(), it is in principle possible to plot 'hclust' object horizontally, without conversion into dendrogram, like series of segments

Idea: extract 'clipper' and adjacent polygon functions from PBSmapping:: sources and make them work from within shipunov::; however, in that case Windows distribution will become more complicated

Note: in bivariate plots, it is better to use xy.coords()

Note: while Fligner-Policello tests are numerous in R packages, pairwise variant is seemingly absent so it is better to keep Rro.test() and pairwise.Rro.test()

Note: there is a package MRH for Multi-Resolution Estimation of the Hazard Rate, and MRH::MRH() so maybe it is worth to rename shipunov::MRH() or somehow mention this
