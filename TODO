Biokey(): test more, fill gaps in conversion pairs, add object type checks

Make Coarse(phylo) on the base of ape::di2multi() which allows for given number of hierarchies (maybe, by iteration), collapsing and keeping nodes based on other criteria (e.g., bootstrap support)

Make Normalize.ranks(classif) to (1) fit ranks into given list and (2) propagate main (whole numbers) ranks (based on code from Biokey())

Make milti-key as function which questions table of binary variables and taxon rows with a string like "1010M1UB" (with missing, unknown and both)

Make tool to make dichotomous key from binary table, use rpart:: as helper

Check how alternatives of shipunov::pairwise.Table2.test() and shipunov::Rro.test() work and change help files accordingly

Dotchart1(): send this as dotchart() correction to R base

MrBayes(): think how to standardize writing Nexus, now there are two ways, "old ips" and "direct"

BestOverlap(): think how to make it work with Ellipses() (and return all total overlaps if needed); try parallel::mclapply()

Life(): think how to add interactive filling with locator() and also separate startup from running

In Ellipses() and Hulls(), it is better to calculate "coords" first, then plot

In bivariate plots, it is better to use xy.coords()

In Boot...() functions, it is probably better to use Class.sample() and Misclass() (their reduced versions are using internally)

Think how extract 'clipper' and adjacent polygon functions from PBSmapping:: sources and make them work from within shipunov::; however, in that case Windows distribution will become more complicated

Gap.code(): try to optimize more; possible alternative: rle() each sequence, then extract pos/len of gaps and match (and check inclusions) sequence gaps in the union of all gaps
