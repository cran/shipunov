Life(): decrease borders in image()

Add jacknife option to Bclust()

Biokey(): convert all to "typographic"; convert all to "latex" (relative or not); try rpart-like objects; use shortcuts; add checks; [assign attributes]

Bivariate plots better to use xy.coords()

Check how alternatives of shipunov::pairwise.Table2.test() and shipunov::Rro.test() work and change help files accordingly

Dotchart1(): send this as dotchart() correction to R base

Ellipses() and Hulls() better to calculate "coords" first, then plot

Misstats() to take Misclass() output and print it like Misclass() replacing "0" with "-"; to print also 'binom.test(sum(diag(x)), sum(x))$conf.int' and 'mcnemar.test(x)$p.value',

BestMisclass() -- similar but much simpler then BestOverlap(), good for "whibo"

Think how to make BestOverlap() work with Ellipses() and return all total overlaps (and maybe everything at all) if needed

Try parallel::mclapply() for BestOverlap()

Gap.code(): try to optimize more; possible alternative: rle() each sequence, then extract pos/len of gaps and match (and check inclusions) sequence gaps in the union of all gaps

Life(): try to add interactive filling with locator() like in Miney()

Misplot() based on Dotchart3() with CIs and double obs/pred labels

Re-structure Boot...() functions to use Class.sample() and Misclass() (their reduced versions are using internally)

Think how extract 'clipper' and adjacent polygon functions from PBSmapping:: sources and make them work from within shipunov::; however, in that case Windows distribution will become more complicated
