Biokey(): Newick to classif; coarsening of hcl; convert all to "typographic"; convert all to "latex" (relative or not); add checks

Life(): decrease border in image(); try to add interactive filling with locator() like in Miney()

Check how alternatives of shipunov::pairwise.Table2.test() and shipunov::Rro.test() work and change help files accordingly

Dotchart1(): send this as dotchart() correction to R base

BestOverlap(): think how to make it work with Ellipses() (and return all total overlaps if needed); try parallel::mclapply()

In Ellipses() and Hulls(), it is better to calculate "coords" first, then plot

In bivariate plots, it is better to use xy.coords()

In Boot...() functions, it is probably better to use Class.sample() and Misclass() (their reduced versions are using internally)

Think how extract 'clipper' and adjacent polygon functions from PBSmapping:: sources and make them work from within shipunov::; however, in that case Windows distribution will become more complicated

Gap.code(): try to optimize more; possible alternative: rle() each sequence, then extract pos/len of gaps and match (and check inclusions) sequence gaps in the union of all gaps
