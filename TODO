With R-4, make Dotchart1() just a dotchart() wrapper which converts non-numeric objects first (and signals it), think how to keep the reverse compatibility

With R-4, make Ex.cols() use new palettes and allow it to change palettes

With R-4, make Str(..., as.factor=TRUE) use df <- data.frame(as.list(df), stringsAsFactors=TRUE) and also invisibly output new df

Probably, add Hansen & Rahn (1969) matrix (from colby.edu plant_id.c) to data

Biokey(): test more, fill gaps in conversion pairs, keep node labels (descriptions, taxon names) everywhere, add object type checks, modularize, [make as separate package]

Make Coarse(phylo) on the base of ape::di2multi() which allows for given number of hierarchies (maybe, by iteration), collapsing and keeping nodes using e.g., bootstrap support

Make Normalize.ranks(classif) to (1) fit ranks into given list and (2) propagate main (whole numbers) ranks (based on code from Biokey())

Make tool to make dichotomous key from binary table, use rpart:: as helper; look on DichotomousKey Github package

MrBayes(): think how to standardize writing Nexus, now there are two ways, "old ips" and "direct"

BestOverlap(): try parallel::mclapply(); think of Overlap() for ellipses

In Ellipses() and Hulls(), it is better to calculate "coords" first, then plot

In bivariate plots, it is better to use xy.coords()

Think how to optimize Misclass(..., best=TRUE) more, especially in the cycle part (permutation part probably optimized to the extreme)

Think how extract 'clipper' and adjacent polygon functions from PBSmapping:: sources and make them work from within shipunov::; however, in that case Windows distribution will become more complicated

Gap.code(): try to optimize more; possible alternative: rle() each sequence, then extract pos/len of gaps and match (and check inclusions) sequence gaps in the union of all gaps

While Fligner-Policello tests are numerous in R packages, pairwise variant seemengly absents so it is better to keep Rro.test() and pairwise.Rro.test()

There is a package MRH for Multi-Resolution Estimation of the Hazard Rate, and MRH::MRH() so probably rename shipunov::MRH()

Using Hcoords() and Tcoords, it is in principle possible to plot 'hclust' object horizontally, without conversion into dendrogram, like series of segments
